# Algorithms With Go + Other Algorithm Challenges

Initially, setup this to perform the challenges in algorithmswithgo.com repo.
However, as I've explored more with Hackerrank, exercism.io and other challenges, I decided I'll use this repo for all of these to log my progress.

Any blog progress on this will be posted on [my blog](sheldonhull.com/microblog)

## Setup Exercism

[Get token](https://exercism.io/my/settings).

```shell
exercism configure --token=$TOKEN
```

Configure workspace for CLI to use this repo.

```shell
exercism configure --workspace ${PWD}/exercism.io
```
